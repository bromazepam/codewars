# codewars 
These are my solutions to codewars code katas. My codewars profile
 can be found [here] (https://www.codewars.com/users/bromazepam). 
 
 The files are grouped by programming language and difficulty, 8 kyu being the easiest and 1 kyu the hardest
 . Each file name usually alludes to the topic of the problem.
 Languages used :

 *  [Java] (https://github.com/bromazepam/codewars/tree/master/src/com/company/java)
 *  [SQL] (https://github.com/bromazepam/codewars/tree/master/src/com/company/sql) 

On Codewars, there are two different scales you can level up by
 doing different things:

  * Honor : This is the amount of points you can see in the top
   right corner of the page, when you're connected to Codewars.
    You gain honor points for a lot of things (completing katas,
     translating them, voting, from votes your comments or solutions
      earned, positive votes received on the katas you authored).
  * Rank : This scale is the one defining your current kyu/dan
   badge and the percentage of progress in the stats page of 
   your profile (overall % or % per language). You can level up 
   your rank doing only one thing: solving katas.

My current rank and honor status:
