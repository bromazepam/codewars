#For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement. Your task is to calculate the MIN, MEDIAN and MAX scores of the students from the results table.
#Tables and relationship below:
#Resultant table:
#
#    min
#    median
#    max

SELECT
    MIN(score) AS min,
    (
        SELECT CAST(AVG(score) AS FLOAT)
        FROM (
            SELECT score
            FROM (
                SELECT score, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY score) AS rn, COUNT(*) OVER() AS cnt
                FROM result
            ) t
            WHERE rn IN ((cnt+1)/2, (cnt+2)/2)
        ) s
    ) AS median,
    MAX(score) AS max
FROM result;
