#For this challenge you need to create a RECURSIVE Hierarchical query. You have a table employees of employees,
#you must order each employee by level. You must use a WITH statement and name it employee_levels after
#that has been defined you must select from it.
#
#A Level is in correlation what manager managers the employee. e.g. an employee with a manager_id of NULL is at level 1
#and then direct employees with the employee at level 1 will be level 2.
#employees table schema
#
#    id
#    first_name
#    last_name
#    manager_id (can be NULL)
#
#resultant schema
#
#    level
#    id
#    first_name
#    last_name
#    manager_id (can be NULL)

WITH RECURSIVE employee_levels AS (
    -- Base case: Employees who do not report to anyone (manager_id IS NULL)
    SELECT
        id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        manager_id,
        1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive part: Join each employee with their manager, incrementing the level
    SELECT
        e.id,
        e.first_name,
        e.last_name,
        e.manager_id,
        el.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_levels el ON e.manager_id = el.id
)
