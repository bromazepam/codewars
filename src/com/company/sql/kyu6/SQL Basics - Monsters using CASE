-- You have access to two tables named top_half and bottom_half, as follows:
-- top_half schema
--     id
--     heads
--     arms
--
-- bottom_half schema
--     id
--     legs
--     tails
--
-- You must return a table with the format as follows:
-- output schema
--     id
--     heads
--     legs
--     arms
--     tails
--     species
--
-- The IDs on the tables match to make a full monster. For heads, arms, legs and tails you need to draw in the data from
-- each table.For the species, if the monster has more heads than arms, more tails than legs, or both, it is a 'BEAST'
-- else it is a 'WEIRDO'. This needs to be captured in the species column. All rows should be returned (10).
-- Tests require the use of CASE. Order by species.
